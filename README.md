# Unofficial-NUS-Latex-Thesis-Template

I have created an unofficial NUS thesis template for Doctor of Philosophy degree to facilitate those who want to write their thesis in the LaTex environment. I used this template while writing my Ph.D. thesis in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS).
The template format was created based on NUS Guidelines on Format of Research Thesis submitted for Examination. However, it is quite easy to change it for different guidelines at the user's will.
The template is available for download in plain LaTex format.
The best way to start using it is to download the template, unzip, and modify it to your requirements. The Final.pdf file is an example of how the thesis looks like by using this template.
